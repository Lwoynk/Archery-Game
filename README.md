### Character Properties
- Each character has:
  - Position (x,y coordinates)
  - Health (60, 80, or 100)
  - Set number (1, 2, or 3)

### Battle Mechanics
1. Player places character A
2. Characters B and C are randomly placed
3. Battles occur between closest characters
4. Combat is determined by:
   - Set number differences
   - Manhattan distance
   - Character health
5. Characters turn red when defeated

### Scoring System
- Score calculation: `(Manhattan distance Ã— 10) + (100 - (health - 25))`
- Higher scores win
- Health reduces by 25 after combat

### Distance Rules
